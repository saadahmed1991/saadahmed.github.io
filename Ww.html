    <h2>Certificates and Courses</h2>
    <p>
        I am continuously improving my skills through various certificates and courses in programming,
         artificial intelligence, and creative design. One of my key accomplishments is earning a certificate from Coursera,
          which has significantly enhanced my understanding of the subject. These educational opportunities help me 
          stay up to date with the latest technologies and explore innovative solutions. Although I am still in the process of building
           my portfolio of certifications, I am dedicated to lifelong learning and actively seek training programs
           that align with my interests and career goals.
