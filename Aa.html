    <h2>Education</h2>
    <p>
        I am currently a student at the Faculty of Artificial Intelligence at Delta University,<br>
     where I explore the ever-evolving world of technology and innovation. My academic journey focuses on<br>
      understanding programming and intelligent applications, alongside my passion for creative fields like video design.<br>
       I always strive to excel in my studies and apply what I learn to practical projects that help develop <br>
       the skills needed in this exciting field. I view university education as not just a way to gain knowledge<br>
        but also as a tool to build my future and contribute to technological advancement.<br>
