    <h2>Technologies</h2>
    <p>
        I work with a range of modern technologies to deliver innovative solutions.
        My focus includes programming languages like Python, JavaScript, and C++,
         along with frameworks and libraries such as TensorFlow for AI development and React for web applications.
          In video design, I utilize tools like Adobe Premiere Pro and After Effects to create professional-quality videos.
           I am constantly exploring new technologies to stay ahead in the ever-evolving fields of programming and creative design.
